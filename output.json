It encompasses world-leading broadcasters and some of the best museums and art galleries globally; their collections contain objects that are as important as anything in any other collection in the world.\n\nMost institutions are looking hard at how they open up access to these collections, but in an environment where nearly every public sector institution is facing substantial funding challenges are they getting enough support? Richard Leeming talks about the work of the Research and Education Space and suggests that open data could transform the galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) sector.\n\nAbout Richard Leeming\nRichard is the external relationship manager at the Research and Education Space, a three-way partnership between the BBC, Jisc and the British Universities Film and Video Council (BUFVC). He is building a Linked Open Data platform which will power better learning experiences and make it easier and more efficient for collection holders to enable access to their precious assets.\n\nWatch a video of the presentation here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pfo_sw_EQ0\n\nfind out more about ODI events here http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures\n\n","dateCreated":"2016-05-20T18:03:20Z"},{"title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Martin Vowels introduces Grace, a bot to boost your wellbeing at work","genre":"Learning","likes":1,"duration":"13:42:10","url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-martin-vowels-introduces-grace-a-bot-to-boost-your-wellbeing-at-work","playback_count":374,"tags":"\"Open Data, \" \"mental health\" stress work employment HR Plexus bot lecture","description":"Plexus is a mental wellbeing startup that aims to support people in and out of work.\n\nIn striving to reflect, review and help empower change in people’s daily lives, Plexus builds on the NHS 5 steps to wellbeing and government reports into digital empowerment in the workplace.\n\nSince winning the ODI Showcase in 2015, the first product that Plexus has produced is ‘Grace’, an AI bot. For five minutes each day, Grace asks users questions about their challenges, confidence, positivity and how useful they have felt the day has been. Users can then explore the data they record in weekly, customised emails and a personalisable online dashboard.\n\nPlexus also uses machine learning to direct users to its knowledge base, which aggregates data sourced from over 25 different government services, NGOs and charities including Mind, Martin Lewis’s Money Saving Expert and Shelter. Open data sits at the heart of this process, from supporting users learn to helping develop Grace’s ability to understand and predict. A primary goal for Plexus is to produce meaningful open datasets that have the power to shape service provision on a regional and national level.\n\nAbout Martin Vowles\nMartin Vowles is Creative Director & co-Founder of M/A and also CEO of Plexus.

Open data has great potential to help drive poverty eradication and improve global development outcomes. Data usage, however, remains relatively low. In the UK, for instance, a third of the datasets found on the government’s online portal have never been used.\n\nOne reason for this is because it is hard to join-up data relating to funding, people and outcomes since it is published in different formats, and to different standards. This means that potential users of the data can’t easily see how various bits of data relate to each other.\n\nThe Joined-Up Data Standards project has been exploring how data standards can be joined-up, using linked data and semantic mapping. While it is technically possible to join-up data standards in this way, political will and cooperation are key to making it happen.\n\nIn this lecture, Tom Orrell will explain the work of the Joined-Up Data Standards project and outline political solutions at the international level for more interoperability between data standards, with the ultimate aim of improving decision-making and accountability.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nTom Orrell is Publish What You Fund’s Senior Advocacy Advisor for the Joined-Up Data Standards project, run jointly by Publish What You Fund and Development Initiatives. Tom’s role is to highlight the value that joining up data standards can deliver for standard setters, data producers and users alike. Tom’s experience lies in the development and humanitarian, digital and data policy, and human rights sectors. He has previously worked as a consultant for UNICEF in Ethiopia and Togo, as a programme manager at Global Partners Digital, as a public law caseworker, and as a consultant for the Overseas Development Institute, Article 19, and others.

But how are these numbers created? Where does the data come from? What are the ecosystems, or the flows of data, that make these measurements possible? More importantly, how can we improve this data for better decision making?\n\nWe first looked at the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and how it uses data from alternative sources to get a more real-time view of the economy. Next, we analysed some of the data to measure net zero. Particularly greenhouse gas emissions data from the ONS and the database on potential CO2 storage sites from the British Geological Survey.\n\nIn our final part of this work, we look at data to measure wellbeing in the UK.  Measuring wellbeing is a topic with a real breadth of research behind it and drives policymaking in a number of countries. There have been quite a number of indexes to measure wellbeing. These include the Human Development Index, the Genuine Progress Indicator, the Better Life Index, and the ONS's National Wellbeing Dashboard.\n \nTo help us gain a better understanding of this topic, we spoke to two experts on wellbeing in the UK: Jennifer Wallace, Director at the Carnegie UK Trust, and Nancy Hey, Executive Director at the What Works Centre for Wellbeing. \n\nLINKS\nJennifer Wallace, Director at Carnegie UK: \n- Carnegie UK: https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/\n- Carnegie's 'Gross Domestic Wellbeing' report: https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/publications/gross-domestic-wellbeing-gdwe-an-alternative-measure-of-social-progress/\n- Jennifer's book 'Wellbeing and Devolution': https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-02230-3\n- Jennifer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Jen_CarnegieUK\n\nNancy Hey, Executive Director at What Works Centre for Wellbeing:\n- What Works Wellbeing: https://whatworkswellbeing.org/\n- Nancy on Twitter: https://twitter.com/work_life_you\n\nWellbeing reports – Office of National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing\n\nODI’s work on data to measure the economy and net zero:\n- Real-time data to measure the economy: insights from the ONS: https://theodi.org/article/real-time-data-to-measure-the-economy-insights-from-the-ons/\n- Build Back Better: the data behind UK’s net zero transition: https://theodi.org/article/build-back-better-the-data-behind-uks-net-zero-transition/\n- Analysis on the data to measure the UK's net zero goals: https://github.com/theodi/data-ecosystems-net-zero/blob/main/UKNetZero.ipynb\n\nSome other indexes of social progress:\n- Human Development Index: https://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi\n- Better Life Index: https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\n- Thriving Places Index: https://www.centreforthrivingplaces.org/\n- Happy Planet Index: https://happyplanetindex.org/\n- Community Needs Index: https://ocsi.uk/2019/10/21/community-needs-index-measuring-social-and-cultural-factors/\n- Genuine Progress Indicator: https://sustainable-economy.org/genuine-progress/","dateCreated":"2022-03-08T12:15:10Z"},{"title":"ODI Fridays: How the BBC builds public service recommenders with data","genre":"Technology","likes":0,"duration":"10:36:57","url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-how-the-bbc-builds-public-service-recommenders-with-data","playback_count":256,"tags":"","description":"The BBC is one of the world’s leading broadcasters, producing a large amount of content including video, audio and text, spanning topics such as news, sport, education, and entertainment.

If we want to prevent or treat birth defects, it’s vital that we understand how different gene mutations affect embryos as they develop.\n\nThe DMDD (Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders) programme is tacking this issue by studying the effects of 240 different gene mutations in mouse embryos. In the spirit of open data, the project has made all its data freely available, to encourage collaboration and, ultimately, lead to better understanding of genetic disease.\n\nAbout the speaker\nDr Tim Mohun is a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in central London. His research group studies the genetic controls that regulate embryo development, focussing on how the heart is formed. Much of his work uses animal models such as the mouse. Tim also coordinates the DMDD programme.\n\nPlease note: The DMDD’s work is based on studies with mice and subscribe to the highest standards for animal welfare in their research. The lecture will include some examples of this work.","dateCreated":"2017-05-12T14:12:58Z"},{"title":"ODI Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Open your offing data","genre":"Technology","likes":1,"duration":"02:55:57","url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-your-offing-data","playback_count":91,"tags":"data \"open data\" swear ofcom offensive context culture broadcasting research watershed MaryWhitehouse censorship lecture London","description":"One of the UK’s regulators, Ofcom, published new research on offensive language last year.

There are three ways of looking at Brexit and open government: 1) possible changes to old policies and new ones being pushed, 2) the new Prime Minister either championing transparency or supporting secrecy, and 3) the openness of the Brexit process itself, which has so far struggled between the executive’s secretive prerogative powers and the legislature’s rights to know.\n\nMay’s government will be seen as one that prized secrecy but conceded openness, an object (and abject) lesson in how hard it is to keep government closed in the 21st century. The May administration 2016–2017 is likely to be remembered as a secretive one, headed by a Prime Minister that wished to govern through confidentiality and closed networks. There were some high-profile openness policies, but they were inherited and slow.\n\nIn this lecture, Ben Worthy will explain how Brexit shows how badly the approach misfired. The government’s plan of no ‘running commentary’ and secrecy was undermined by the Supreme Court, the UK Parliament and the EU Commission – who all forced greater transparency and greatly limited May’s room for manoeuvre and concealment. The three institutions – creating and using ‘institution friction’ to open up government – also exposed the government’s lack of preparation and undermined the UK’s credibility and leverage even before Brexit began.\n\n\nSpeaker biography\nBen Worthy is a lecturer in Politics at Birkbeck College, University of London.

Should it be saved as XML, JSON, CSV? Should dates be written YYYY-MM-DD? What order should the columns be in? These types of questions are essential and catered for in most well-established data standards.\n\nSemantics are more abstract. Questions arise, like: what does this data tell me about the world? What does this number mean? What is the purpose of that transaction? Answering these is more variable and often less formal than the syntax. The most common and trusted technique is to create a codelist – a dictionary of terms which establishes the semantics for a given data point. They can be simple sets of terms – detailing transaction types which can be published in a standard – all the way to rich hierarchical taxonomies. They all associate a code with a meaning, to allow people to communicate with them.\n\nThis talk explores the changing role of codelists in a time when textual data analysis is advancing rapidly. The root question is this: is it still best to start giving meaning to your data by looking for a codelist and a code, or can we use description text itself, trusting modern data analysis to do the heavy lifting?\n\nFirst, we'll consider and contextualise the use of codelists within standards like Open Contracting, IATI, and 360Giving. Then we'll look at how meaning can be established in text where no standard exists – online reviews for restaurants, for example – by applying machine learning (live demo alert!). Finally, we'll apply the same approach to description text found in established open data standards and compare our results.\n\nRory Scott is a member of the Open Data Services Cooperative, working with national governments, multilateral organisations, and civil society to better share, understand, and use open data about international development and humanitarian financing.

Our new project looks at whether new platforms and sources, from TheyWorkToYou to IPSA’s expenses map, are changing the behaviour of those being watched and the attitudes of those watching.\n\nOur findings so far show how the new data are being used by a range of people, from activists and journalists to MPs themselves. All these new sources are, at least sometimes, making MPs and Peers more accountable, and subtly impacting upon how they represent us.

The pandemic has – rightly – become the focus of much of the planet and in the scramble to manage local outbreaks and protect national economies, new ways of collating information ‘to protect the public’ have been rolled out on masse. The pandemic, and our response to it, has brought to the fore many questions in relation to how and who collects, uses maps and understands data.\n\nHowever, this is nothing new. While the idea of data driving our lives is newly confronting to many, such technologies – and their failings – have long been used to shape the lives, and deaths, of millions around the world. In the digital age, mapping and data continue to be seen as a fix-all. More people than ever are subjected to having their lives dictated not by elected officials, but by black box algorithms, maps, and data visualisations. As our attempts to hold the pandemic at bay continue, we must look at lessons from other crises and push for a more just world.\n\nIn this lunchtime lecture, Doug Specht (University of Westminster) and Monika Halkort (Lebanese American University), draw upon their research and recent publication, Mapping Crisis (2020, University of London Press) to examine the use of data in times of crisis and draw out ethical discussion and chart ways we can work better for the good of humanity.\n\nAbout the speakers\nDoug Specht is a Chartered Geographer (CGeog. FRGS), a Senior Lecturer (SFHEA) and the Director of Teaching and Learning in the School of Media and Communication at the University of Westminster.

Her research centres on the intersectional dynamics of digital materiality, race and dehumanisation in contemporary data regimes. Taking irregular migration in the Mediterranean as an example, her most recent work unpacks how conflicting horizons of death are negotiated and modelled in data, opening up new zones of non-being that have been characteristic of modern coloniality.","dateCreated":"2021-02-06T12:56:40Z"},{"title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Data federations – collaborate without sharing","genre":"Technology","likes":1,"duration":"17:23:49","url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-federations-collaborate-without-sharing","playback_count":340,"tags":"","description":"Data assets have more value when used collaboratively than on their own. For many organisations, however, this kind of collaboration is currently very difficult, whether because the data they handle is private or otherwise sensitive, or they lack the resources and know-how to embark on large-scale cooperative projects.\n\nThe concept of ‘data federations’ offers a model which allows multiple parties to commit their digital assets to a shared project whilst retaining control over the extent to which their data is exposed, as well as reducing the need for standardisation. This is achieved through a flexible, purpose-oriented approach to collaboration building combined with the deployment of privacy-preserving technologies such as distributed data mining or federated learning, which allow insights or predictive models to be generated from data without requiring it to be gathered in a central location.\n\nIn this talk, writer and researcher Richard Woodall will describe how, by offering an alternative path towards collaboration, a ‘data federation’ opens the benefits to a new range of people, allowing smaller and less digitally mature organisations the chance to develop shared value from their digital assets, cultivate cooperative relationships, and build their capacity for strategic coordination.\n\nAbout the speaker\nRichard Woodall is a writer and researcher with an interest in the culture and political economy of digital technologies.

How it is collected, used and shared can have huge impacts – both direct and indirect – on people’s lives. Data and its (mis)use shape how companies profit, how we consume, even how governments see and serve their populations.\nBut while some organisations are speaking more about responsible data and ethics, many members of the public still aren’t engaged. They see it as boring, dry or too technical to understand – let alone something they can have any real agency over. This is not their fault, but is often because they have not had enough opportunities to meaningfully engage. This needs to change.\nIn this lecture, Anna Scott will talk through creative approaches to engaging people in data issues – from illustrated reports to artworks, games to shadow puppets.

While the UK government is currently investing in the “best” ways to plan, create, and fund vital infrastructure projects, they argue that engaging with crucial questions around control, ownership and access to data requires an understanding of their physical components and context.\n\nWesley Goatley is an artist and researcher.\n\nGeorgina Voss is a technology anthropologist, writer, and co-founder of research co-operative “Strange Telemetry”.","dateCreated":"2015-11-20T13:42:01Z"},{"title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Landscape Watch Hampshire – crowdsourcing landscape change","genre":"ODIFridays","likes":0,"duration":"10:01:12","url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-landscape-watch-hampshire-crowdsourcing-landscape-change","playback_count":410,"tags":"open data institute landscape watch hampshire crowdsourcing Tim Pearson dan cooper Karen Masters","description":"Landscape Watch Hampshire is a new community project to characterise the county’s landscape in 2005 and 2013 by analysing aerial photos, held as open data by Hampshire County Council, and thereby identify the changes that have taken place over a period of eight years; the output from the project will be made available as open data via the Hampshire Hub as it becomes available.\n\nHampshire County Council, on behalf of the Hampshire Hub Partnership, is collaborating with Remote Sensing Applications Consultants Ltd (RSAC) and the University of Portsmouth (UoP) on the Crowdsourcing Landscape Change project, co-funded by Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board).\n\nOur videos: bit.ly/odi_vimeo\nOur photos: bit.ly/odi_flickr\nOur audio: bit.ly/odi_soundcloud\nOur slides: bit.ly/odi_scribd\nOur tweets: bit.ly/ODIHQ_tweets\nOur website: theodi.org\nODI Summit videos: bit.ly/odisummit_video\nWhat is open data?: bit.ly/what-is-open-data\n","dateCreated":"2015-10-16T13:17:13Z"},{"title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Open wide: how Freedom of Information and open data can work together","genre":"ODIFridays","likes":0,"duration":"23:42:46","url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-wide-how-freedom-of-information-and-open-data-can-work-together","playback_count":368,"tags":"ODI open data Matt Burgess FOI freedom information","description":"Both the Freedom of Information (FOI) and open data schemes are well established but they don’t always work together to achieve a common aim of making information more accessible.\n\nMatt Burgess will examine how FOI and open data can be combined to enhance the UK’s openness.

It encompasses world-leading broadcasters and some of the best museums and art galleries globally; their collections contain objects that are as important as anything in any other collection in the world.\n\nMost institutions are looking hard at how they open up access to these collections, but in an environment where nearly every public sector institution is facing substantial funding challenges are they getting enough support?

For five minutes each day, Grace asks users questions about their challenges, confidence, positivity and how useful they have felt the day has been. Users can then explore the data they record in weekly, customised emails and a personalisable online dashboard.\n\nPlexus also uses machine learning to direct users to its knowledge base, which aggregates data sourced from over 25 different government services, NGOs and charities including Mind, Martin Lewis’s Money Saving Expert and Shelter. Open data sits at the heart of this process, from supporting users learn to helping develop Grace’s ability to understand and predict. A primary goal for Plexus is to produce meaningful open datasets that have the power to shape service provision on a regional and national level.\n\nAbout Martin Vowles\nMartin Vowles is Creative Director & co-Founder of M/A and also CEO of Plexus. With a MA in Communication Art and Design from the Royal College of Art, in 2008 Martin co-founded digital design studio M/A, which has created digital and physical design products for Mind, NSPCC, Southbank Centre, Tommy’s, Visit Bankside, Headlong, Sam Mcknight and Kings College.\n\nMartin’s interests include Typography, civic tech, data visualisation and encrypted fabric printing and you can find him on twitter @martininma.\n\nWatch a video of the lecture here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkayFmLj9zk\n\nFind out more about ODI events here https://theodi.org/events","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2641330,"full_duration":2641330,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Learning","has_downloads_left":false,"id":267254722,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:55Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-martin-vowels-introduces-grace-a-bot-to-boost-your-wellbeing-at-work","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-martin-vowels-introduces-grace-a-bot-to-boost-your-wellbeing-at-work","playback_count":374,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":null,"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"Open Data, \" \"mental health\" stress work employment HR Plexus bot lecture","title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Martin Vowels introduces Grace, a bot to boost your wellbeing at work","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/267254722","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:267254722","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/RuNJ7UsqeHLw_m.json","display_date":"2016-06-03T11:48:24Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:267254722/269db2ff-6d85-4925-a3a5-0aeff53fe462/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2641330,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:267254722/269db2ff-6d85-4925-a3a5-0aeff53fe462/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2641330,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:267254722/699e1dc3-72e2-4815-baa7-ecb21dc8257e/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2641330,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg;

You bring your lunch, we provide tea and coffee, an interesting talk, and enough time to get back to your desk.\n\nCode is all about pattern. Beyond computer programming, this means code can also be well-suited to creating musical patterns – not only in recordings, but also during live performances.\n\nIn this lecture, algorage pioneer and ODI Sound Artist in Residence Alex McLean will talk about live coding of music and how it’s development over the past 16 years. He will relate this history to the open data movement, describing how live coders have opened up and shared the underlying structures of their music as free or open source software. Alex will wrap up with some thoughts and predictions around where he thinks live coding is going, both in terms of creative practice and its wider cultural influences.\n\nAlex McLean is a live coding musician and software artist based in Sheffield UK. He’s been making people dance to code since 2001 through a range of musical collaborations, including with Slub, Canute, xynaaxmue and aalleexx. He releases his “polyrhythmic and hyperreal strand of techno” (bleep.com) on Sheffield label Computer Club, in particular Peak Cut EP (2015) and his forthcoming album Spicule. Alex co-founded the Algorave and TOPLAP live coding movements, and the AlgoMech festival of algorithmic and mechanical movement, the first edition of which takes place 12-20 November 2016 in Sheffield. Alex works as a generalist as a member of FoAM Kernow. During 2016 he is Sound Artist in Residence at ODI HQ, supported by the Sound and Music national organisation for new music.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1949779,"full_duration":1949779,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":281065380,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:55Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":3,"permalink":"sound-artist-alex-mclean-on-live-coding-algoraves-and-opening-up-music-algorithms","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/sound-artist-alex-mclean-on-live-coding-algoraves-and-opening-up-music-algorithms","playback_count":467,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":281065380,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:281065380"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"sound art\" coding Technology opendata composing","title":"Sound Artist Alex McLean on Live coding, algoraves and opening up music algorithms","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/281065380","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:281065380","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/Ud5VSUNlrpYh_m.json","display_date":"2016-09-02T14:19:24Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:281065380/a2a6cf97-99fb-425b-afe7-08470e73cfc9/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1949779,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:281065380/a2a6cf97-99fb-425b-afe7-08470e73cfc9/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1949779,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:281065380/59ebec76-634d-4d57-ab47-d3ddb7d5d424/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":1949779,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:281065380","station_permalink":"track-stations:281065380","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

In this lunchtime lecture we will hear from three open data leaders working to achieve SDGs in different contexts. In particular, their work supports Goal 17 and its sub-target to increase the availability of high-quality data in national contexts, and part of Goal 16, to provide access to justice for all.\n\nLinet Kwamboka Nyang’au\nAs coordinator of Kenya’s Open Data Initiative, will reflect on experience she’s gained creating policies and partnerships to encourage government institutions to open their data, ensure government transparency and involve citizens in decision making.\n\nSandra Elena\nAs coordinator of the Open Justice Programme at Argentina’s Ministry of Justice, Sandra will share insights into what it takes to convene over 50 judicial institutions around a standardised regulatory framework for producing and publishing data, as well as engaging civil society and promoting new technologies as part of the Justice 2020 programme.\n\nNeil Hoorn\nAs Open Data Project Manager in the municipal government of Cape Town, Neil has has been instrumental in the rapid development of the City of Cape Town’s Open Data Project.

In the UK, for instance, a third of the datasets found on the government’s online portal have never been used.\n\nOne reason for this is because it is hard to join-up data relating to funding, people and outcomes since it is published in different formats, and to different standards. This means that potential users of the data can’t easily see how various bits of data relate to each other.\n\nThe Joined-Up Data Standards project has been exploring how data standards can be joined-up, using linked data and semantic mapping. While it is technically possible to join-up data standards in this way, political will and cooperation are key to making it happen.\n\nIn this lecture, Tom Orrell will explain the work of the Joined-Up Data Standards project and outline political solutions at the international level for more interoperability between data standards, with the ultimate aim of improving decision-making and accountability.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nTom Orrell is Publish What You Fund’s Senior Advocacy Advisor for the Joined-Up Data Standards project, run jointly by Publish What You Fund and Development Initiatives. Tom’s role is to highlight the value that joining up data standards can deliver for standard setters, data producers and users alike. Tom’s experience lies in the development and humanitarian, digital and data policy, and human rights sectors. He has previously worked as a consultant for UNICEF in Ethiopia and Togo, as a programme manager at Global Partners Digital, as a public law caseworker, and as a consultant for the Overseas Development Institute, Article 19, and others. Tom was Called to the Bar of England and Wales in 2011 and holds a BA in International Relations from Keele University.\n\nFind out more about the ODI Friday Lunchtime Lecture series http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2237048,"full_duration":2237048,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":284584608,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:55Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":3,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-why-joined-up-data-is-a-political-not-technical-challenge","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-why-joined-up-data-is-a-political-not-technical-challenge","playback_count":306,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":284584608,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:284584608"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"Open Data\" Transparency Government Politics","title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Why joined-up data is a political, not technical, challenge","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284584608","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:284584608","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/p7D5hqns7ngo_m.json","display_date":"2016-09-25T17:34:32Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:284584608/8f553ddf-a2e8-4725-a976-ce7f82e8d0dc/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2237048,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:284584608/8f553ddf-a2e8-4725-a976-ce7f82e8d0dc/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2237048,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:284584608","station_permalink":"track-stations:284584608","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

In this talk you’ll learn how CSVW can make working with CSV easier and connect you to a web of linked-data.\n\nThe humble CSV format is a popular way of publishing open data, and with good reason. It’s easy to create and edit, non-proprietary and machine-readable. It isn’t particularly standardised however and you’ll usually need to do some work to interpret the contents correctly.\n\nThe CSVW standard helps to solve these problems letting you focus on using the data. It also lets us interpret data in a global context by connecting tables together into a web of linked-data.\n\nAbout the speakers\nRobin Gower\nRobin dreams of a day when data scientists can focus on analysis instead of spending their time preparing data!\n\nTo this end, he works as a Data Designer at Swirrl helping publishers to express their datasets with linked-data. He draws on 15 years experience consulting as an economist and statistician for the UK public and social sectors.\n\nRobin a founding member of Open Data Manchester and wrote and maintains several open source software libraries.\n\nHe now lives with his family in Berlin, tinkering with electronics and brewing English ale.\n\nRoss Bowen\nRoss is all too familiar with wrangling data out of spreadsheets with his favourite programming language, R.\n\nAs a statistician who’s worked across several government departments, he is now revolutionising data publishing at the ONS as part of the Integrated Data Programme.\n\nWhen Ross discovered the world of linked-data, he was immediately excited for its potential in helping people better explore and understand statistics.\n\nAt home in Bridgend you’ll often find him practising the piano or pretending to be a superstar DJ.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2542733,"full_duration":2542733,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1238822782,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2022-03-25T19:13:48Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-fridays-csv-on-the-web","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-csv-on-the-web","playback_count":183,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1238822782,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1238822782","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"ODI Fridays: CSV on the web","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1238822782","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1238822782","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/MlCCAa06FUde_m.json","display_date":"2022-03-25T19:12:46Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1238822782/b31ec48e-2a9f-4c92-8473-e8ed6834095d/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_1_0","duration":2542733,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1238822782/b31ec48e-2a9f-4c92-8473-e8ed6834095d/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_1_0","duration":2542733,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1238822782/ef269f64-2cc5-4d63-af46-e9cc65e46cf3/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2542690,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1238822782","station_permalink":"track-stations:1238822782","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

If an organisation is open about how it gathers, shares and uses data – particularly personal and sensitive data – it will have a positive impact on their brand. However, this also requires a high level of data literacy within the organisation, and an ability to think and work critically with data.\n\nIn this latest episode of ODI’s Inside Business podcast, Stuart Coleman, the ODI’s Learning and Business Development Director, speaks to panellists Alessandro Piscopo, Principal Data Scientist at BBC Datalabs, Di Mayze, Global Head of AI and Data at WPP and Jen Rodvold, Head of Digital Ethics and Tech for Good at Sopra Steria.\n\nThey explore how their organisations embed data literacy within their teams, how this positively impacts their brands, and what some of the challenges will be in the future.\n\nThe podcast covers:\n\n- How data literacy is developed in their organisations\n- How they set up good practices, particularly in response to the loss of trust in data that was brought about by scandals such as Facebook/Cambridge Analytica\n- How data ethics are embedded into data use, including personalisation\n- The tensions between trust and innovation\n- Algorithms and transparency\n- Next steps in data literacy and predictions for the future\n\nUSEFUL LINKS\n\nThe ODI website: https://theodi.org/\n\nPodcast webpage on the ODI website: https://theodi.org/article/podcast-the-role-of-data-literacy-in-building-a-trusted-brand/\n\nThe ODI’s position on data literacy (blog):  https://theodi.org/article/data-literacy-what-is-it-and-how-do-we-address-it-at-odi/\n\nODI’s data literacy resources: https://theodi.org/article/introducing-the-data-literacy-programme/\n\nODI training courses: https://theodi.org/events/courses/\n\nBecome an ODI member: https://theodi.org/service/membership-networking/","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1668284,"full_duration":1668284,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Business","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1231681141,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2022-03-13T21:11:07Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":2,"permalink":"odi-inside-business-the-role-of-data-literacy-in-building-a-trusted-brand","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-inside-business-the-role-of-data-literacy-in-building-a-trusted-brand","playback_count":252,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1231681141,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1231681141","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"Data literacy\" \"@Data ethics\"","title":"ODI Inside Business: The role of data literacy in building a trusted brand","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1231681141","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1231681141","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/Pq6nSw6li6n7_m.json","display_date":"2022-03-13T20:53:43Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1231681141/3bb1f62c-deae-4e8e-b0c2-d776070bd2e5/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1668284,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1231681141/3bb1f62c-deae-4e8e-b0c2-d776070bd2e5/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1668284,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1231681141/5f9643bb-6a86-4555-91d4-321be9437147/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":1668252,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1231681141","station_permalink":"track-stations:1231681141","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

But how are these numbers created? Where does the data come from? What are the ecosystems, or the flows of data, that make these measurements possible? More importantly, how can we improve this data for better decision making?\n\nWe first looked at the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and how it uses data from alternative sources to get a more real-time view of the economy. Next, we analysed some of the data to measure net zero. Particularly greenhouse gas emissions data from the ONS and the database on potential CO2 storage sites from the British Geological Survey.\n\nIn our final part of this work, we look at data to measure wellbeing in the UK.  Measuring wellbeing is a topic with a real breadth of research behind it and drives policymaking in a number of countries. There have been quite a number of indexes to measure wellbeing. These include the Human Development Index, the Genuine Progress Indicator, the Better Life Index, and the ONS's National Wellbeing Dashboard.\n \nTo help us gain a better understanding of this topic, we spoke to two experts on wellbeing in the UK: Jennifer Wallace, Director at the Carnegie UK Trust, and Nancy Hey, Executive Director at the What Works Centre for Wellbeing. \n\nLINKS\nJennifer Wallace, Director at Carnegie UK: \n- Carnegie UK: https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/\n- Carnegie's 'Gross Domestic Wellbeing' report: https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/publications/gross-domestic-wellbeing-gdwe-an-alternative-measure-of-social-progress/\n- Jennifer's book 'Wellbeing and Devolution': https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-02230-3\n- Jennifer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Jen_CarnegieUK\n\nNancy Hey, Executive Director at What Works Centre for Wellbeing:\n- What Works Wellbeing: https://whatworkswellbeing.org/\n- Nancy on Twitter: https://twitter.com/work_life_you\n\nWellbeing reports – Office of National Statistics: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing\n\nODI’s work on data to measure the economy and net zero:\n- Real-time data to measure the economy: insights from the ONS: https://theodi.org/article/real-time-data-to-measure-the-economy-insights-from-the-ons/\n- Build Back Better: the data behind UK’s net zero transition: https://theodi.org/article/build-back-better-the-data-behind-uks-net-zero-transition/\n- Analysis on the data to measure the UK's net zero goals: https://github.com/theodi/data-ecosystems-net-zero/blob/main/UKNetZero.ipynb\n\nSome other indexes of social progress:\n- Human Development Index: https://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi\n- Better Life Index: https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\n- Thriving Places Index: https://www.centreforthrivingplaces.org/\n- Happy Planet Index: https://happyplanetindex.org/\n- Community Needs Index: https://ocsi.uk/2019/10/21/community-needs-index-measuring-social-and-cultural-factors/\n- Genuine Progress Indicator: https://sustainable-economy.org/genuine-progress/","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1832699,"full_duration":1832699,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1228521064,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2022-03-08T14:45:24Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"data-to-measure-uk-wellbeing","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/data-to-measure-uk-wellbeing","playback_count":206,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1228521064,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1228521064","artist":"Open Data Institute Podcast","album_title":"Open Data Institute Podcast","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"Data Wellbeing","title":"Data to Measure UK Wellbeing","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1228521064","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1228521064","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/srkphmlvvbzZ_m.json","display_date":"2022-03-08T14:45:24Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1228521064/e77a1f99-c24b-48b8-a86b-76732e51acae/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1832699,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1228521064/e77a1f99-c24b-48b8-a86b-76732e51acae/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1832699,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1228521064/017dfdb9-4525-4561-9d89-a0baff9ad45c/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":1832679,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1228521064","station_permalink":"track-stations:1228521064","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

In order to fulfil its public service remit, the BBC must serve all its audiences, providing each audience member with the most relevant and engaging content for them.\n\nUp to now, manual curation has been the main approach used by the organisation to achieve that. However, that comes with some challenges: it is unable to scale and to be tailored to each user. Datalab has followed an approach based on cross-team collaboration and on the concept of public service AI to address these challenges.

Their owners remain hidden, escaping accountability and passing the costs of their illicit activities onto communities.\n\nHow can beneficial ownership data help solve these problems? Why should it be available as open data? And what are the lessons learned from the UK’s first ever open data register of beneficial ownership?\n\nIn this lecture, Zosia Sztykowski from OpenOwnership will answer the questions and give a sneak peak of the OpenOwnership Register – a platform for global beneficial ownership information being developed by OpenCorporates, Global Witness, Open Contracting Partnership, The B Team, The Web Foundation and Transparency International.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nZosia Sztykowski is the Project Coordinator for OpenOwnership, a new project to build a open register of global beneficial ownership in the public interest. With a background in cultural analysis and feminist organising, Zosia is dedicated to effecting policy and shifting norms in the interest of a more equal, more open society. Zosia recently graduated with an MSc in cultural sociology from the London School of Economics, where she earned the Hobhouse Memorial Prize for her dissertation research.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2315318,"full_duration":2315318,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":304798982,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-beneficial-data-help-curb-corruption","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-friday-lunchtime-lecture-can-open-beneficial-data-help-curb-corruption","playback_count":282,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":304798982,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:304798982"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"open data\" corruption \"tax avoidance\" \"shell company\" \"holding company\" transparency accountability Business finance crime criminal OpenOwnership \"Zosia Sztykowski\" \"tax haven\" \"Global Witness\" lecture london ODI \"Open Data Institute\" \"Panama Papers\" \"Data Journalism\"","title":"ODI Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Can open beneficial data help curb corruption?","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/304798982","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:304798982","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/onxD8zBLZ5ku_m.json","display_date":"2017-01-27T14:57:18Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:304798982/83df96d7-a438-49ca-81d2-1888bd661bdb/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2315318,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:304798982/83df96d7-a438-49ca-81d2-1888bd661bdb/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2315318,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:304798982/18988683-33e6-4e13-bdf8-a7df7a03bc53/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2315318,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:304798982","station_permalink":"track-stations:304798982","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

In any case you need to carefully and objectively analyse the facts and judge them based on legal precedent and principles of justice.\n\nOpen data and digital technologies are arguably bringing about an unprecedented change in how we engage with the law, since more firms are adopting machine learning to help with due diligence, compliance and contract review. As legal aid budgets get smaller, is the legal sector ready for online dispute resolution to democratise access to legal information?\n\nIn this lecture, Callum Murray sets out what he foresees as the future of machine learning in the legal sector and the open legal data infrastructure that underpins it.\n\nAbout the speaker\nCallum Murray is CEO of graduated ODI Startup Amiqus, which uses machine learning and open data to build tools that make civil justice available to everyone.

From the social graph to the knowledge graph, the interest graph to the transactions graph, proprietary data networks drive the generation of new power and capital.\n\nSuch graphs are used to make algorithmic predictions and optimisations about our future activities. Only those who can aggregate and hedge raw data emerge as the new power players. This situation creates a new imbalance of power, which can be understood with the concept of data asymmetry.\n\nIn fact, mapping and analysing data networks provide immense opportunities to civil society. In this talk, Burak Arıkan will present the Graph Commons platform and how individuals and small organisations use it to transform their data into interactive maps and untangle complex relations that impact them and their communities.\n\nAbout Burak Arikan\nBurak Arikan is a New York and Istanbul-based artist working with complex networks. He takes the obvious social, economical and political issues as input and runs through an abstract machinery, which generates network maps and algorithmic interfaces, results in performances and procreates predictions to render inherent power relationships visible and discussable. Arikan’s software, prints, installations, and performances have been featured in numerous exhibitions internationally. Arikan is the founder of Graph Commons, a collaborative platform for network mapping, analysis and publishing.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3270079,"full_duration":3270079,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":292555880,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":2,"permalink":"odi-friday-lunchtime-lecture-creative-and-critical-use-of-complex-networks","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-friday-lunchtime-lecture-creative-and-critical-use-of-complex-networks","playback_count":271,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":292555880,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:292555880"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"Politics Turkey \"data mapping\" \"data analysis\" \"open data\" data transparency government \"Burak Arikan\" Art \"new york\" \"open data institute\" London lecture","title":"ODI Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Creative and critical  use of complex networks","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/292555880","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:292555880","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/ets88UPtadjl_m.json","display_date":"2016-11-11T15:22:40Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:292555880/fa62a444-2cd2-405b-93b8-28f2bc10b5ad/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3270079,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:292555880/fa62a444-2cd2-405b-93b8-28f2bc10b5ad/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3270079,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:292555880/6fedfe24-b9b0-4ac2-bc2d-83b83bdccf3f/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3270079,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:292555880","station_permalink":"track-stations:292555880","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

People’s rights to consent, privacy, security and ownership are important to keep in mind while collecting, analysing, storing, presenting and reusing data.\n\nWith that in mind, why is responsible data important for the open data movement? How can the principles and practice of responsible data be incorporated into open data initiatives?\n\nAlix Dunn will talk about the foundations of the responsible data community, where it is headed and how responsible data tactics can inform considerations about what data is made available. She will take a look at how those decisions are made, and how intermediary organisations can help by building responsible data into their strategies. Alix will also look at different sectors that are struggling to understand the potential unintended harm that opening some data can have.\n\nAbout Alix Dunn\nAlix is the Executive Director and co-founder of The Engine Room, an international organisation that helps social change initiatives and other change agents make the most of data and technology to increase their impact. She is a recovering researcher with a passion for applying creative solutions to difficult problems. She works on identifying data and technology techniques and strategies that can empower social change initiatives around the world to maximise their impact and make the most of their resources.

Over the years, they have evolved from straight-up inventory management to online publications with digitised images for all to see.\n\nIn early 2017 the Science Museum Group relaunched its online collection of digitised objects, under a Creative Commons licence via a public API. The museum hopes that the open data will be used in many ways. Researchers might use it to explore the collection using computation analysis, software programmers might use it to explore new interfaces and discovery tools for the collection, and creatives might use the data and images in their work.\n\nThis lecture will present the outcomes from a hack day held in February to bring together technologists, designers and creatives to experiment with how this open data could be used. The hack day was run as part of the museum’s Digital Lab initiative, supported by Samsung.\n\nAbout the speakers\nJohn Stack is Digital Director of the Science Museum Group. He joined the group in 2015 and is responsible for setting and delivering the group’s digital strategy. Prior to joining the Science Museum Group, he was Head of Digital at Tate for ten years.\n\nDave Patten is Head of New Media at the Science Museum. He manages all aspects of new media from conceptual design to prototyping and production. He has a background in electronics and computer science, and has worked at the Science Museum for over 30 years.\n\nJamie Unwin is Technical Architect for the Science Museum’s Collection Online. Since building a web-based London Underground route finder for his BSc project in 1995, Jamie helped launch The Guardian website and later set up a platform used by the BBC, The Guardian, Sony Playstation and London 2012 Olympics. In 2015 he joined the Science Museum to wrangle data and systems to relaunch the collection website.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2872745,"full_duration":2872745,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":313456268,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":3,"permalink":"odi-friday-lunchtime-lecture-opening-up-the-science-museum","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-friday-lunchtime-lecture-opening-up-the-science-museum","playback_count":110,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":313456268,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:313456268"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"science museum\" \"museum collection\" \"open data\" \"data architecture\" \"public engagement\" \"digital engagement\" archive \"museum archive\" \"digital archive\" \"hack day\" hackathon \"data policy\" API \"creative commons\" London lecture \"open data institute\"","title":"ODI Friday lunchtime lecture: Opening up the Science Museum","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/313456268","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:313456268","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/WyBJOz6Eifby_m.json","display_date":"2017-03-20T17:15:49Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:313456268/821d7eba-a351-413e-8b72-23e58a64a829/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2872745,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:313456268/821d7eba-a351-413e-8b72-23e58a64a829/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2872745,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:313456268/93e9d471-4891-492f-8509-efed08c0aa73/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2872745,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:313456268","station_permalink":"track-stations:313456268","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

Its vision is that UK grantmaking is more informed, effective and strategic.\n\n360Giving supports organisations to publish their grants data in an open, standardised way and helps people to understand and use the data in order to support decision-making and learning across the charitable giving sector. They’ve developed an open data standard as part of their work – the 360Giving Standard – and already some of the largest UK grantmakers are using it to share information about thousands of grants worth billions of pounds.\n\n360Giving is also supporting the development of tools and platforms that allow easy access and use of the data, including Beehive Giving and GrantNav. As the dataset grows, they’re starting to test its usefulness via a series of data use pilots, starting in Manchester.\n\nThis lunchtime lecture will focus on 360’s progress so far, including challenges and lessons learned.

Genetic heart conditions, for example, affect around 1% of all newborns, and in around 10 times as many cases they may lead to miscarriage. If we want to prevent or treat birth defects, it’s vital that we understand how different gene mutations affect embryos as they develop.\n\nThe DMDD (Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders) programme is tacking this issue by studying the effects of 240 different gene mutations in mouse embryos. In the spirit of open data, the project has made all its data freely available, to encourage collaboration and, ultimately, lead to better understanding of genetic disease.\n\nAbout the speaker\nDr Tim Mohun is a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in central London. His research group studies the genetic controls that regulate embryo development, focussing on how the heart is formed. Much of his work uses animal models such as the mouse. Tim also coordinates the DMDD programme.\n\nPlease note: The DMDD’s work is based on studies with mice and subscribe to the highest standards for animal welfare in their research. The lecture will include some examples of this work.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2595900,"full_duration":2595900,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Science","has_downloads_left":false,"id":322272169,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-using-open-data-to-understand-the-causes-of-genetic-birth-defects","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-using-open-data-to-understand-the-causes-of-genetic-birth-defects","playback_count":85,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":322272169,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:322272169"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"genetics DNA \"birth defects\" Science research \"Francis crick institute\" \"Tim Mohun\" biology mice embryo mutation \"gene mutation\" \"open data\" \"open data institute\" London lecture","title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: using open data to understand the causes of genetic birth defects","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/322272169","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:322272169","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/ytwN3o69GHG5_m.json","display_date":"2017-05-12T14:12:58Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:322272169/7e0303db-5105-4ddd-874e-613e8cb951e3/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2595900,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:322272169/7e0303db-5105-4ddd-874e-613e8cb951e3/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2595900,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:322272169/30a8ff50-877e-40a5-bf1f-df42c3e4579a/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2595900,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:322272169","station_permalink":"track-stations:322272169","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

There are three ways of looking at Brexit and open government: 1) possible changes to old policies and new ones being pushed, 2) the new Prime Minister either championing transparency or supporting secrecy, and 3) the openness of the Brexit process itself, which has so far struggled between the executive’s secretive prerogative powers and the legislature’s rights to know.\n\nMay’s government will be seen as one that prized secrecy but conceded openness, an object (and abject) lesson in how hard it is to keep government closed in the 21st century. The May administration 2016–2017 is likely to be remembered as a secretive one, headed by a Prime Minister that wished to govern through confidentiality and closed networks. There were some high-profile openness policies, but they were inherited and slow.\n\nIn this lecture, Ben Worthy will explain how Brexit shows how badly the approach misfired. The government’s plan of no ‘running commentary’ and secrecy was undermined by the Supreme Court, the UK Parliament and the EU Commission – who all forced greater transparency and greatly limited May’s room for manoeuvre and concealment. The three institutions – creating and using ‘institution friction’ to open up government – also exposed the government’s lack of preparation and undermined the UK’s credibility and leverage even before Brexit began.\n\n\nSpeaker biography\nBen Worthy is a lecturer in Politics at Birkbeck College, University of London. He has written extensively on issues around Transparency, Openness and Freedom of Information including co-authoring the book Does FOI Work? His latest book is ‘The Politics of Freedom of Information: How and Why Governments Pass Laws That Threaten Their Power’ (Manchester: MUP) and you can read an extract here.\n\nHe is also researching the impact of the UK Government’s Transparency Agenda and is also the Independent Reporter on the UK’s Open Government National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership. He was previously Research Associate in Freedom of Information at UCL’s Constitution Unit.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3045221,"full_duration":3045221,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"News & Politics","has_downloads_left":false,"id":333177247,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":4,"permalink":"brexit-and-open-government-in-the-uk-11-months-of-may","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/brexit-and-open-government-in-the-uk-11-months-of-may","playback_count":135,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":333177247,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:333177247"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"lecture \"open data\" transparency \"freedom of information\" FOI Law government policy \"civil society\" \"Prime Minister\" \"Theresa May\" ODI \"David Cameron\" \"European Union\" legislation \"withdrawal act\" \"article 50\"","title":"Brexit and open government in the UK: 11 months of May","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333177247","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:333177247","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/qIfMbEIvk5Xk_m.json","display_date":"2017-07-14T14:25:50Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:333177247/9644709c-032d-4b3d-a5ae-53ca98dbfcc6/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3045221,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:333177247/9644709c-032d-4b3d-a5ae-53ca98dbfcc6/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3045221,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:333177247/739b468f-5f4d-4dfe-9bb6-0ea867ca85b5/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3045221,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:333177247","station_permalink":"track-stations:333177247","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

This talk will reflect on and review some of these achievements and look to the future, asking questions like ‘How does open data relate to data that is closed or shared?’ and ‘Does open data help us empower individuals?’\n\nAbout the speaker\nProfessor Sir Nigel Shadbolt is Chairman and Co-Founder of the Open Data Institute. He is also Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Head of the Web and Internet Science Group, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton. With over 400 publications he has researched on topics ranging from cognitive psychology to computational neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence to the Semantic Web. He was one of the originators of the interdisciplinary field of Web Science and is a Director of the Web Science Trust which seeks to advance our understanding of the Web and promote the Web’s positive impact on society.\n\nIn 2009 the Prime Minister appointed him and Sir Tim Berners-Lee as Information Advisors to transform access to Public Sector Information. This work led to the highly acclaimed data.gov.uk site that now provides a portal to over 9,000 datasets.\n\nIn May 2010 he was asked by the UK Coalition Government to join the Public Sector Transparency Board – this oversees Open Data releases across the public sector. In April 2011 he became Chair of the UK Government’s midata programme – whose goal is to empower consumers by releasing their data back to them. In the November 2011 Autumn statement he was awarded £10M funding via the Technology Strategy Board to set up the Open Data Institute with Sir Tim Berners-Lee.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3277863,"full_duration":3277863,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":350661550,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-sir-nigel-shadbolt-whats-the-future-of-open-data","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-sir-nigel-shadbolt-whats-the-future-of-open-data","playback_count":96,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":350661550,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:350661550"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"open data\" technology transparency","title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Sir Nigel Shadbolt - What's the future of open data?","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/350661550","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:350661550","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/sb6dIyyPcjwM_m.json","display_date":"2017-11-03T15:47:21Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:350661550/46e851ba-d4c1-4d47-834f-3803845a8c3d/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3277863,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:350661550/46e851ba-d4c1-4d47-834f-3803845a8c3d/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3277863,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:350661550/adb6ecdf-474b-4cc2-bd2d-87f5f1fa7e3d/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3277863,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:350661550","station_permalink":"track-stations:350661550","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

This means that many people are paying more than they should for their banking activities and are not benefiting from new services.\n\nAs a result, Open Banking was set up in September 2016 to enable personal customers and small businesses to share their data securely with other banks and with third parties, allowing them to compare products on the basis of their own requirements and to manage their accounts without having to use their bank.\n\nTo deliver Open Banking, a new organisation was created - the Open Banking Implementation Entity – which is funded by the nine largest current account providers in the UK (Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Barclays, Danske, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS Group, Santander), as well as Challenger Banks, Fintechs, Third Parties, Consumer Groups and other parties to define and develop the required Application Programme Interfaces (APIs), security and data standards that underpin Open Banking.\n\nImran Gulamhuseinwala OBE, Implementation Trustee of the Open Banking Implementation Entity will talk about the challenges and the progress made to date on Open Banking.\n\nAbout the speaker\nImran Gulamhuseinwala OBE was appointed as Trustee for the Open Banking Implementation Entity on 13 April 2017. In his role as Trustee, he has oversight and responsibility for Open Banking’s development and delivery of the common technical standards underpinning the Competition and Market Authority’s (CMA) open banking initiative.\n\nHe is seconded to Open Banking from Ernst & Young LLP (EY) where he is a London-based partner in its financial services practice. He is also EY’s Global Head of FinTech. He joined EY in 2014.

The UK average house price has increased 30% since the 2008 crash, and London house prices have gone up 75%, according to the Land Registry House price index from September 2008 to September 2017. In London, price increases are often blamed on empty homes bought as investments by rich foreigners. Areas such as Cornwall and the Lake District blame price increases on holiday homes bought by rich Londoners. However, there is very little data supporting or against these beliefs.\n\nJonathan Bourne spent a year sending Freedom of Information requests to gather a dataset from over 100 local authorities. He was interested in data on 'low use properties', which are domestic properties that contain no full-time resident. The data covers 22 million people and 330,000 low-use properties. The data shows a clear relationship between price and low-use properties.\n\nIn this talk, Jonathan will discuss his findings, showing how London is affected in the same way as the rest of the country and that building more houses may not help solve the problem of high prices. He will also describe how he got the data and what he learned about the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nJonathan Bourne is a data scientist who previously worked in the energy industry and is currently studying for a PhD in Complex Networks at University College London. When he has the time, he blogs on SomeSquaredError.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2692327,"full_duration":2692327,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"News & Politics","has_downloads_left":false,"id":360358295,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":2,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-empty-homes-and-house-prices-is-there-a-relationship","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-empty-homes-and-house-prices-is-there-a-relationship","playback_count":105,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":360358295,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:360358295"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":1,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"house prices\" housing homes \"property \" \"property market\" \"holiday homes\" \"second homes\" \"vacant property\" \"empty houses\" \"open data\" \"ghost housing\" Uk","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Empty homes and house prices: is there a relationship?","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/360358295","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:360358295","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/xgnjrW8Nh6jI_m.json","display_date":"2017-11-24T16:22:02Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:360358295/c8882956-56c0-47b7-a962-e0ceeec2a00f/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2692327,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:360358295/c8882956-56c0-47b7-a962-e0ceeec2a00f/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2692327,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:360358295/b03a1eac-8e4f-4bce-b5d8-1551d65a35c7/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2692327,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:360358295","station_permalink":"track-stations:360358295","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

Should it be saved as XML, JSON, CSV? Should dates be written YYYY-MM-DD? What order should the columns be in? These types of questions are essential and catered for in most well-established data standards.\n\nSemantics are more abstract. Questions arise, like: what does this data tell me about the world? What does this number mean? What is the purpose of that transaction? Answering these is more variable and often less formal than the syntax. The most common and trusted technique is to create a codelist – a dictionary of terms which establishes the semantics for a given data point. They can be simple sets of terms – detailing transaction types which can be published in a standard – all the way to rich hierarchical taxonomies. They all associate a code with a meaning, to allow people to communicate with them.\n\nThis talk explores the changing role of codelists in a time when textual data analysis is advancing rapidly. The root question is this: is it still best to start giving meaning to your data by looking for a codelist and a code, or can we use description text itself, trusting modern data analysis to do the heavy lifting?\n\nFirst, we'll consider and contextualise the use of codelists within standards like Open Contracting, IATI, and 360Giving. Then we'll look at how meaning can be established in text where no standard exists – online reviews for restaurants, for example – by applying machine learning (live demo alert!). Finally, we'll apply the same approach to description text found in established open data standards and compare our results.\n\nRory Scott is a member of the Open Data Services Cooperative, working with national governments, multilateral organisations, and civil society to better share, understand, and use open data about international development and humanitarian financing.

Andy Radford, Transport Planner at Birmingham City Council, had a very different experience. Let him take you back to 2014...\n\n\"My colleague had masterminded a successful bid for a European Project, Opticities, and then abruptly left the organisation. My task was to open up real-time transport datasets in a matter of months, with very little budget and no background in open data.\n\n\"What followed did not follow a traditional route – the only goal was to get the data from our internal systems onto the internet as quickly as possible. Once that was done, I entered a world completely unfamiliar to the average local authority transport planner – working in partnership with SME’s, Universities, the ODI etc.\n\n\"The session will be particularly appropriate for local authority staff, but anyone working with open data or in the transport field should learn something useful. Not everything was a bed of roses - I learned some lessons the hard way, so that you won’t have to.\n\n\"This talk will tell a heart-warming tale of what can be achieved in the local authority environment with people who are willing to learn and have a can-do attitude.\"\n\nAbout the speaker\nAndy Radford has worked as a transport planner at Birmingham City Council for 17 years. In his current role as Principal Infrastructure Delivery Officer, he has responsibility for a number of grant funded transport research and innovation projects, focussed in the field of intelligent mobility.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2464491,"full_duration":2464491,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":385990940,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-the-local-authority-that-went-guerrilla","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-the-local-authority-that-went-guerrilla","playback_count":117,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":385990940,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:385990940"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"Open data\" birmingham transport policy infrastructure","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: The local authority that went 'guerrilla'","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/385990940","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:385990940","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/9Qy6fl7aYQDM_m.json","display_date":"2018-01-19T14:51:19Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:385990940/9f002bc9-8b81-4e30-916e-caff95791981/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2464491,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:385990940/9f002bc9-8b81-4e30-916e-caff95791981/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2464491,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:385990940/1209a4f9-0de4-442c-8b22-ed01cf015334/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2464491,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:385990940","station_permalink":"track-stations:385990940","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

The talk will look at the on-site production of the works at the ODI, and will discuss the issues and ethics around current government policy around encryption technology, which gained particular significance for the artist when he became directly involved in the Manchester terror attack in May 2017. Although the themes and issues discussed are rooted in technology, this talk will be completely suitable for everyone.\n\nPlease note: Dan will discuss potentially distressing themes around the Manchester attack, and the talk will also contain a few images of an implant being put into skin.\n\nyou can watch the lecture here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8KgiJM_348\n\nAbout the speaker\nDan Hett is a BAFTA-winning artist and creative technologist from Manchester, currently working as a selected artist on FutureEverything's cutting-edge FAULT LINES program.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2272420,"full_duration":2272420,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":389443995,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:54Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-hidden-in-plain-sight-by-the-odi-artist-in-residence","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-hidden-in-plain-sight-by-the-odi-artist-in-residence","playback_count":78,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":389443995,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:389443995"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"Art Artist painting implant \"body modification\"","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Hidden in plain sight (by the ODI artist in residence)","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/389443995","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:389443995","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/mkbZD0fpnyEI_m.json","display_date":"2018-01-26T15:05:48Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:389443995/d4752a25-e464-468f-93cb-1f0e25fd0a1f/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2272420,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:389443995/d4752a25-e464-468f-93cb-1f0e25fd0a1f/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2272420,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:389443995/48448bd5-a471-4c8f-9437-a9026a22c2c5/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2272420,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:389443995","station_permalink":"track-stations:389443995","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

This has led to more than 600 apps now being powered specifically using TfL's open data feeds, used by 42 per cent of Londoners.\n\nRikesh Shah, Head of Commercial Innovation at TfL, will talk about their open data journey, how open data has created an eco-system of innovators. Rikesh will also highlight the successful factors and outcomes around start-up engagement with corporates and some of the challenges around procurement.\n\nAbout the speaker\nRikesh Shah is the Head of Commercial Innovation at Transport for London, the authority responsible for delivering the London Mayor’s transport strategy. He has been at TfL for over 16 years, previously in the areas of commercial development, communications and digital.\n\nHe is responsible for creating value in the future mobility space from market innovators including start ups, academics, transport operators, regional agencies, R&D organisations and corporates. This involves on-going engagement with this community, utilising the right procurement processes, developing the right culture and providing the right level of access to data and policy makers.\n\nPrevious to this role, Rikesh led TfL’s open data programme, digital commercial activity, stakeholder engagement and communications supporting TfL’s digital transformation strategy. By building digital and data partnerships with start- ups, as well as leading technology platforms including Twitter, Amazon and Google, Rikesh has been at the forefront of TfL’s Open Data provision to over 13,000 developers producing over 600 customer facing travel apps used by 42% of Londoners.

Working in Afghanistan, the Southern Arabian Gulf and Sierra Leone, this experience led him to the belief that the level of cognitive diversity and connectivity in teams fuels understanding. He believes that in the data rich and complex business world leaders face today, using this to build understanding is and will continue to be the source of competitive advantage.\nAs leader of Connectworxs, he is passionate about helping teams achieve foresight, by connecting their questions to data to business value, and sharing those insights across organisational silos. This will drive growth for organisations and build the right data-driven culture.\n\nWatch a video of Graham's lecture here https://youtu.be/paojVUhcMfA","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2301838,"full_duration":2301838,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":435983085,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:53Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-seeing-around-corners","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-seeing-around-corners","playback_count":102,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":435983085,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:435983085"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Seeing around corners","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/435983085","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:435983085","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/WhFW3bBtVZPW_m.json","display_date":"2018-04-27T13:51:35Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:435983085/b4679839-84ce-4db5-8dd9-5daf74ed6732/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2301838,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:435983085/b4679839-84ce-4db5-8dd9-5daf74ed6732/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2301838,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:435983085/368d5e4f-1c91-4b47-bc1e-526ce43d87e6/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2301838,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:435983085","station_permalink":"track-stations:435983085","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

A CSV that doesn’t load, a spreadsheet that is badly formatted, a date column that has different formats, and so on. A lot of time is spent fixing these issues, instead of actually analysing the data. In this talk, you’ll hear about Good Tables, a tabular data validator that is able to check for issues like:\nAll rows have the same number of columns\nThere are no duplicate rows\nThe data types are correct (e.g. a numeric column has only numbers, a date column has only dates in a specific format, etc.)\nIt also allows writing custom checks using Python.\nGoodtables is useful both if you are a data publisher, by helping you to increase your data quality and facilitate the data reusability, and if you are a data user, by giving you a quick way to check the data for errors. It can be executed locally or via https://goodtables.io, a continuous tabular data validation service.\nYou’ll also understand about how the Frictionless Data’s Data Package and Table Schema specifications can help you describe and load datasets.\nAbout the speaker\nVitor Baptista is the engineering lead for the Open Knowledge International. Since joining in 2012, he worked on a range of projects related to open data, like building data portals using CKAN, improving fiscal transparency with OpenSpending, aggregating and releasing clinical trial data with OpenTrials, and more. His main interests are in how we can use data and data visualization to make better decisions to improve the world.

New service delivery models – an Open Data Institute (ODI) project – was started in 2017 to increase the understanding of data-enabled service delivery models in local government, and to improve services encourage publishing more open data to improve public services.\nAs part of the project, we awarded funding to four forward-thinking local government organisations to develop open data projects which explore how data could be used to improve public services – making them more efficient, innovative and citizen-focused.\nSince the beginning of the project, four local councils have redesigned services for their local communities by using open data\nThe project is part of the ODI’s £6M three-year innovation programme, which has an overall aim to build data infrastructure, improve data literacy, stimulate data innovation and build trust in the use of data.\nIn this talk ODI Consultant Izy Champion will talk you through the research, give examples of the innovative services created through the innovative use of data, and talk about opportunities to get involved with our project for 2018-19 looking at Service design learning materials\nAbout the speaker\nIzy joined the ODI as a Consultant in November 2017. She is working across our Research and Development programme, including as the lead on the ODI’s work on peer-to-peer accommodation, as well as working with our commercial partners.\nHer expertise covers service design, innovation and facilitation. She has a background in research and community engagement, and as a result she loves getting people excited about data. Before joining the ODI Isabelle worked in the social housing sector for 5 years, most recently as a Research and Innovation Lead at Viridian Housing. During her time there she led a range of projects including research on welfare reform, process mapping work across the business, and winning the Housing Series of the Open Data Challenge Series along with her team.\nIzy has an LLB in Law and French Law from University College London, and is currently studying for an MSc in Policy Research from the University of Bristol. When not reading about feminism and social justice, she takes pretentious film photographs and makes her own clothes.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1651720,"full_duration":1651720,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":442610781,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:53Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-fridays-how-local-services-are-being-transformed-with-open-data","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-how-local-services-are-being-transformed-with-open-data","playback_count":224,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":442610781,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:442610781"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"ODI Fridays: How local services are being transformed with open data","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/442610781","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:442610781","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/SOTUf0UNO5vA_m.json","display_date":"2018-05-11T14:49:09Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:442610781/6eab2989-fa91-49fc-98e8-ff4c38d4425e/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1651720,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:442610781/6eab2989-fa91-49fc-98e8-ff4c38d4425e/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1651720,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:442610781/93dc91ba-1ef4-40fd-94ac-80e50a6f1c99/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":1651720,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:442610781","station_permalink":"track-stations:442610781","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

In this lunchtime lecture, hear from ONS and Swirrl about their work on a project that reaches across the Government Statistical Service and aims to support you in finding, understanding and using government statistical data.\n\nThe project flips the traditional way of organising government data on its head and considers data in terms of families: groups of related data collections, rather than in terms of which organisation it comes from. Its aim is to break down the barriers to finding, understanding and applying data from related datasets and to make collaborative work possible through comparable and interoperable data.\n\nAbout the speakers\nDr Bill Roberts is CEO of Swirrl, the Data Publishers, and is an enthusiast for using the Web to share public sector data more effectively. As well as working with Swirrl on various government open data projects, he is an active member of the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group, where he is currently leading work on ‘Statistics on the Web Best Practices’.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2723886,"full_duration":2723886,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":465108930,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:53Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-fridays-find-analyse-and-use-government-statistical-data","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-find-analyse-and-use-government-statistical-data","playback_count":104,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":465108930,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:465108930"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"data \"open data\" \"open government\" \"government statistics\" \"data analy\" ONS \"Office for National Statis\"","title":"ODI Fridays: Find, analyse and use government statistical data","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/465108930","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:465108930","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/M578WWqPIvxA_m.json","display_date":"2018-06-29T14:11:28Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:465108930/daee0447-511a-4c79-837d-306c1533184a/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2723886,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:465108930/daee0447-511a-4c79-837d-306c1533184a/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2723886,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:465108930/38f941fd-56c5-4f22-af37-2059b024be96/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2723886,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:465108930","station_permalink":"track-stations:465108930","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

The command-and-control model is doomed to failure here by the very nature of the network. This is inevitable”. Many of the pioneers of open data, such as Tim Berners-Lee and Richard Stallman, have shared this vision.\nYet the world of finance is still predicated on the command-and-control model. A small number of giant banks control the market in commercial and retail lending, the insurance world is dominated by a handful of large players, who alone have access to the corridors of central banks and regulators.\nDean Buckner, a retired specialist at the Bank of England, explains how the secretive nature of regulation threatens, rather than supports, the stability of the financial system.\nAbout the speaker\nDean Buckner worked at the FSA and then the Prudential Regulation Authority and Bank of England for nearly 20 years, specialising in asset valuation and capital modeling in both the banking and life insurance sector. After he retired from the Bank in January 2018 he set up Eumaeus.org with Kevin Dowd of Durham University, a project to ‘keep an eye on’ regulatory institutions such as the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority and to campaign for regulatory reform, particularly around the need for the financial regulatory system to be more open.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3694400,"full_duration":3694400,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":572172348,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:53Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-fridays-routing-around-malfunction-can-the-financial-system-ever-be-open","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-routing-around-malfunction-can-the-financial-system-ever-be-open","playback_count":117,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":572172348,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:572172348","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"ODI Fridays: Routing around malfunction – can the financial system ever be open?","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/572172348","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:572172348","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/2VJk41tnNsva_m.json","display_date":"2019-02-08T15:35:05Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:572172348/12776931-4503-481f-8b2e-55dec06902df/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3694400,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:572172348/12776931-4503-481f-8b2e-55dec06902df/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":3694400,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:572172348/08c4425a-64f3-4e01-8cfb-434fb9fac0df/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3693987,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:572172348","station_permalink":"track-stations:572172348","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

Discover the risks and learn about the ODI’s plans to help organisations mitigate those risks.\nAnonymisation is a set of tools, algorithms and best practices to remove personal information from a dataset while maintaining as much of the data’s utility as possible.\nIn this lecture, Fionntán O’Donnell, the ODI’s Senior Data Technologist, will talk about how to take your data through the anonymisation process in this important, wide-ranging, yet nuanced, subject.\nIn the ODI we believe data should be as open as possible. However, we also believe people who handle that data should do so in a responsible manner. Stewards of data must balance the good of opening and sharing data while handling the risk in sensitive data about people being exposed.\nAbout the speaker\nFionntán O’Donnell is a Senior Data Technologist and researches how best to use artificial intelligence (AI) and data in fair, accountable and transparent ways.\nHe’s been knocking about researching AI for over a decade now. Initially at the National University of Ireland Galway looking at the semantic web. Then he headed off to Ghent University to study deep learning back before it was even called deep learning. Then to Dublin in the ADAPT Centre, developing machine-learning prototypes in the innovation team. After that he got the boat to London where he worked for the BBC, designing machine-learning systems for News Labs and investigating what AI should mean for a public service broadcaster.\nHe’s called a data technologist because his work is in the intersection between software engineering, research, design, and communication. It can be an odd intersection at times but he’s happy to be there.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2884083,"full_duration":2884083,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":601397409,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:53Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-fridays-with-great-personal-data-comes-great-anonymity","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-with-great-personal-data-comes-great-anonymity","playback_count":121,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":601397409,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:601397409","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"ODI Fridays: With great personal data comes great anonymity","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/601397409","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:601397409","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/PpkopX6wmble_m.json","display_date":"2019-04-05T13:56:49Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:601397409/a1625d67-f92f-4c43-bf1c-9a1af94035b2/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2884083,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:601397409/a1625d67-f92f-4c43-bf1c-9a1af94035b2/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":2884083,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:601397409/cb0a886d-2503-47c9-8a24-4e7ddc86bbac/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2883743,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:601397409","station_permalink":"track-stations:601397409","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

Each work was initially hosted by another artist. The network exists through a collaborative act of care and stewardship. Visitors are also invited to participate in this. Each of the works has been created within the constraints of a 2mb file size and without external dependencies.\n\nAbout the speakers\nMateus Domingos is an artist/writer based in Leicester, UK. In parallel with his artistic practice, he is a producer for the digital arts programme at Phoenix, Leicester. Alongside the exhibition programme he works on artist development opportunities and hosts a series of meet-ups exploring digital arts practices. He regularly publishes and facilitates workshops that explore creative coding and various digital technologies. He is interested in text, narrative and the use of new digital spaces. His work has included games, 3d printing, fictional alphabets, maps and filmmaking. He runs a publishing project called Bruise.\n\nLarisa Blazic is a London-based digital artisan, educator and feminist hacker with practice ranging from net.art to Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) art and design. She explores a range of emerging technologies and their impact on online publishing, moving image in public space, collective creativity and participation through work exhibited nationally, internationally and online. The philosophy driving her art practice is founded on FLOSS philosophy and culture aiming to enable a deep, systematic and critical understanding of the technical, social and cultural contexts where creative practice and technology intersect in order to apply these in contemporary art and design.\n\nAilie Rutherford is a visual artist working at the intersection of community activism and creative practice. Her collaborative artworks bring people together in conversations about our social and economic landscape using print, performance, sci-fi visioning, games and technology as playful means to work through difficult questions and radically re-think our shared futures. Resulting works range from proposed new models for living and working together to the building of new infrastructure.\n\nShinji Toya is a digital artist from Japan, based in London in the UK for more than a decade. His practice uses creative programming, artificial intelligence, the Internet, participation, video, image manipulation and painting. It deals with the poetic aspects emerging in the tension between what the systems of knowledge and computation aim to capture and what they fail to capture. The recent practice of Toya critically explores the relationship between image, data, and generative processes emerging through networked participation and digital culture(s). This practice often deals with the post-digital data economy and data erasure.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3266403,"full_duration":3266403,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1180272106,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2021-12-18T17:56:53Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-fridays-finding-new-ways-to-share-digital-art","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-finding-new-ways-to-share-digital-art","playback_count":280,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1180272106,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1180272106","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"ODI Fridays: Finding new ways to share digital art","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1180272106","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1180272106","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/LEuEcBB2hV6D_m.json","display_date":"2021-12-18T17:53:41Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1180272106/fe8961bf-4538-4745-9a07-981c963db865/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":3266403,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1180272106/fe8961bf-4538-4745-9a07-981c963db865/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":3266403,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1180272106/b47457ef-9c5f-48df-b2ae-a9594a94faa1/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3266379,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1180272106","station_permalink":"track-stations:1180272106","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

City planners, architects, developers and engineers are faced with a plethora of data that exist in orthogonal layers, limiting their ability to interrogate how city systems interact.\n\nThe solution includes new technologies that can unlock greater value from myriad open data sources by stitching them together in a systematic, semantic model of the world. We can get more out of existing open data with the right tools. This lecture will introduce Diagonal’s approach to building data models for data science in the built environment.\n\nAbout the speakers\nClaire Fram\n\nClaire specialises in delivering digital tools for city planning. She is a founding member and Product Manager at Diagonal, building tools and visualisations that unlock creativity, progress and better decisions in the built environment. She’s currently on maternity leave from Arup, where she’s been the product lead for their agent based modelling toolkit – building a suite of data processing tools to model transport networks, infrastructure, and simulate millions of individuals’ unique days. Claire is interested in open data and inclusive technologies for urban design.\n\nGala Camacho\n\nGala is a mathematician and programmer, with a background in education, optimisation and all-things data. She has worked at big corporations and startups within the civil infrastructure and urban planning ecosystem, leading analytics projects strategically and technically.

Three guests, Julian Tait from Open Data Manchester, Anouk Ruhaak from Mozilla Foundation and Emmett Townsend from Inrupt talk about their own organisations and the challenges and benefits of each approach, before opening out a wider discussion around issues of personal consent, legislation and making such initiatives successful and sustainable.  \n\nIf you are interested in discussing the different types of data institutions and issues of consent around data institutions please get in touch with the team.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1825045,"full_duration":1825045,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Business","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1075701838,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2021-09-14T00:11:06Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"whats-happening-to-my-data-empowering-people-to-take-a-more-active-role-in-data-decision-making","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/whats-happening-to-my-data-empowering-people-to-take-a-more-active-role-in-data-decision-making","playback_count":339,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1075701838,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1075701838","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"Rebalancing power dynamics: how data institutions can help empower people and communities","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1075701838","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1075701838","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/87WMIC4q6KoC_m.json","display_date":"2021-06-25T11:13:59Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1075701838/c5b1c577-1ff5-4600-8915-bf549e495b4e/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1825045,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1075701838/c5b1c577-1ff5-4600-8915-bf549e495b4e/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1825045,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1075701838/67c5e713-0dee-4658-86ac-394208b3aae0/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":1825025,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1075701838","station_permalink":"track-stations:1075701838","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

While national data institutions have the power to issue papers, guidance, and create sound tools for evaluating ethical needs and setting standards, only the Government has the power to make legislation and issue binding policy requirements.\n\nThis talk explores the Government’s practice in one specific area – making legislation relevant to data and digitalisation – though a forensic review of relevant statutes and regulations made in 2020.\n\nDr Sue Chadwick will talk us through her year of statute-stalking, surveying both the content of the legislation made and the way it was made and applied. She will evaluate those practices against some established codes of digital ethics, including the ODI Data Ethics Canvas and the Government’s own Data Ethics Framework.\n\nAbout the speaker\nSue is a Strategic Planning Advisor at Pinsent Masons LLP with a keen – some might say obsessive – interest in data and the way it will transform the property industry and challenge many of its established foundations.\n\nAs one of the ODI’s first ever research fellows she has spent the last year working with their Vice President Jeni Tennison, exploring digital ethics and their implications for planning decisions with a particular focus on human rights, equalities, discrimination, and established codes of practice. Her research is due to be published through the ODI in September.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3107814,"full_duration":3107814,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1066524811,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2021-06-11T13:28:36Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":0,"permalink":"lecture-bounce-1odi-fridays-government-legislation-and-data-ethics1-06-21","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/lecture-bounce-1odi-fridays-government-legislation-and-data-ethics1-06-21","playback_count":324,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1066524811,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1066524811","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"Lecture Bounce 1ODI Fridays: Government legislation and data ethics1 06 21","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1066524811","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1066524811","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/j2lF6Ru3nrkB_m.json","display_date":"2021-06-11T13:25:00Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1066524811/7c425f42-354b-4a50-ae51-236365397d36/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":3107814,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1066524811/7c425f42-354b-4a50-ae51-236365397d36/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":3107814,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1066524811/e9baa495-8b1e-497e-895e-890f31e8b8a4/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3107781,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1066524811","station_permalink":"track-stations:1066524811","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

He will also discuss how the ‘re-defined’ open data fits into China’s digital economy agenda and how ‘openness’ may still survive and be re-introduced into China’s data governance.\n\nPlease note that the talk is pre-recorded, but the Q&A at the end will be live.\n\nAbout the speaker\nDr. Feng Gao is the co-founder and managing director of Open Data China, the first civic group and social enterprise in China working on data transparency and digital rights.

It has the enormous potential to address societal and economic health challenges like early the early detection, screening and monitoring of non-communicable diseases, like Parkinson’s.\n\nTo maximise the potential of AI in the treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), there’s an urgent need to transform the healthcare system by opening access to data collected during healthcare interventions.\n\niKure is a primary healthcare provider with focus on addressing the issues of accessibility, availability, affordability and trust when it comes to connecting patients with healthcare services. Use of technology is an integral part of iKure’s business model and operations, and it has a proprietary medical collaboration platform called Wireless Health Incident Monitoring Systems (WHIMS) that presents unprecedented potential in diffusion of clinical, preventive and diagnostic insights. Utilising data analytics and artificial intelligence, iKure’s technology application is attuned for mapping diseases pattern and aligns clinical decision with actions to improve better health outcomes.\n\nThrough this discussion, we want to bring attention and interest to the small-scale local health data source can serve as a high value open data repository with enormous potential to address non-communicable disease, like hypertension. While big data can provide dramatic advances in the treatment of NCDs, local data – despite its inherent challenges and limitations – in data collection stands as a potentially rich resource in treatment efficacy and health-based studies.\n\nWe will focus on opportunities in data privacy through open data platforms, and challenges that persist in collecting high quality data to find insights of the locally derived relationship between culture, behaviour and clinical information, which may bring shift in care delivery model to better serve the stakeholders in the entire health ecosystem.\n\nAbout the speakers\nTirumala Santra Mandal, PhD, is a Senior Research and Communication Analyst at iKure. She has authored and edited publications for various peer-reviewed journals.\n\nAnindita Dey is a data analyst and machine learning enthusiast at iKure.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1470929,"full_duration":1470929,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1044562735,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2021-05-07T14:10:28Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":0,"permalink":"access-to-the-right-health-data-for-public-good","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/access-to-the-right-health-data-for-public-good","playback_count":309,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1044562735,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1044562735","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"Access to the right health data for public good","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1044562735","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1044562735","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/PXc7lf5q7CSU_m.json","display_date":"2021-05-07T14:09:56Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1044562735/049fe923-ca3e-4753-9da3-26871c7b64ea/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1470929,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1044562735/049fe923-ca3e-4753-9da3-26871c7b64ea/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1470929,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1044562735/f07fea99-0469-4b74-8bc4-632cb6b2bfa8/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":1470904,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1044562735","station_permalink":"track-stations:1044562735","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

Are new sources of data, on everything from expenses to voting to Wikipedia changes, altering how we think about politics? What can the monitoring of parliament tell us about what impact, good or bad, this is having on democracy?\n\nWe can now monitor the activities of our representatives in ways we couldn’t imagine a few decades ago, seeing at the push of a button how they vote, what they say and what they spend. Our new project looks at whether new platforms and sources, from TheyWorkToYou to IPSA’s expenses map, are changing the behaviour of those being watched and the attitudes of those watching.\n\nOur findings so far show how the new data are being used by a range of people, from activists and journalists to MPs themselves. All these new sources are, at least sometimes, making MPs and Peers more accountable, and subtly impacting upon how they represent us. Data has also helped shaped the expenses expense scandal, proxy voting and reform of the House of Lords.\n\nTogether new data makes for a democracy we can shape ourselves and use to question, query, and crowds-source. It can also make those we elect more responsive and more responsible. However, in reporting on voting and expenses, the new data can sometimes reinforce old, unhappy stories we tell each other about politics and politicians.\n\nAbout the speakers\nStefani Langehennig is a researcher in the Department of Politics at Birkbeck, University of London and a Senior Data Scientist in Public Policy at ICF International.

It is gathered by wearable technologies and smartphone apps; it is inferred from shopping habits and online behaviour; it is used by insurers and advertisers for purposes besides healthcare or medical research. This is the datafication of health, and it has significant consequences for people and society.\n\nMy colleagues and I at the Ada Lovelace Institute have been working to better understand the datafication of health: what it is, how it occurs, and its impacts on individual and social wellbeing. We’ve synthesised existing research and surfaced the societal and ethical challenges that occur when the boundaries of what is or isn’t health data become blurred. We’ve put forward evidence that the datafication of health has created an ‘Internet of Health’, in which everyone is made to perform as a patient, subject to continuous monitoring, diagnosis and prediction.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll chart the mechanisms through which datafication occurs and explore how datafication challenges existing practical, legal and conceptual definitions of what counts as ‘health data’.\n\nAbout the speakers\nAidan is a Senior Researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent research and deliberative body with a mission to ensure data and AI work for people and society.

The pandemic has – rightly – become the focus of much of the planet and in the scramble to manage local outbreaks and protect national economies, new ways of collating information ‘to protect the public’ have been rolled out on masse. The pandemic, and our response to it, has brought to the fore many questions in relation to how and who collects, uses maps and understands data.\n\nHowever, this is nothing new. While the idea of data driving our lives is newly confronting to many, such technologies – and their failings – have long been used to shape the lives, and deaths, of millions around the world. In the digital age, mapping and data continue to be seen as a fix-all. More people than ever are subjected to having their lives dictated not by elected officials, but by black box algorithms, maps, and data visualisations. As our attempts to hold the pandemic at bay continue, we must look at lessons from other crises and push for a more just world.\n\nIn this lunchtime lecture, Doug Specht (University of Westminster) and Monika Halkort (Lebanese American University), draw upon their research and recent publication, Mapping Crisis (2020, University of London Press) to examine the use of data in times of crisis and draw out ethical discussion and chart ways we can work better for the good of humanity.\n\nAbout the speakers\nDoug Specht is a Chartered Geographer (CGeog. FRGS), a Senior Lecturer (SFHEA) and the Director of Teaching and Learning in the School of Media and Communication at the University of Westminster. His research examines how knowledge is constructed and codified through digital and cartographic artefacts, focusing on development issues in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, where he has carried out extensive fieldwork. He speaks and writes on topics of data ethics, development, education and mapping practices, is the editor of Mapping Crisis (2020, University of London Press), and co-editor for forthcoming volumes on Geospatial technology and society (2021, Routledge), and Apocalyptic politics in the Anthropocene (2021, Routledge Environmental Humanities).\n\nMonika Halkort is an assistant professor of digital media and social communication at the Lebanese American University. Her research centres on the intersectional dynamics of digital materiality, race and dehumanisation in contemporary data regimes. Taking irregular migration in the Mediterranean as an example, her most recent work unpacks how conflicting horizons of death are negotiated and modelled in data, opening up new zones of non-being that have been characteristic of modern coloniality.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2450103,"full_duration":2450103,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":980268367,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2021-02-06T12:58:39Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":0,"permalink":"odi-fridays-life-death-and-data","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-life-death-and-data","playback_count":270,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":980268367,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:980268367","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"ODI Fridays: Life, death and data","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/980268367","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:980268367","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/eN2me3Gt69ge_m.json","display_date":"2021-02-06T12:56:40Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:980268367/711f0dda-bef3-49c0-9cc4-4667c4b39220/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":2450103,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:980268367/711f0dda-bef3-49c0-9cc4-4667c4b39220/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":2450103,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:980268367/da5bbae8-bd88-4e6c-94d4-3fbabadb2f94/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2450059,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:980268367","station_permalink":"track-stations:980268367","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IjM0ZWFhYmFlLTExYzUtNGRhZS1hODAyLTM0NGE3MjMxYzNmOCIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.vEQu0KYtqxYQjp2Yp54zOHr5PIfXjhSSnRN651N-wDg","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

For many organisations, however, this kind of collaboration is currently very difficult, whether because the data they handle is private or otherwise sensitive, or they lack the resources and know-how to embark on large-scale cooperative projects.\n\nThe concept of ‘data federations’ offers a model which allows multiple parties to commit their digital assets to a shared project whilst retaining control over the extent to which their data is exposed, as well as reducing the need for standardisation. This is achieved through a flexible, purpose-oriented approach to collaboration building combined with the deployment of privacy-preserving technologies such as distributed data mining or federated learning, which allow insights or predictive models to be generated from data without requiring it to be gathered in a central location.\n\nIn this talk, writer and researcher Richard Woodall will describe how, by offering an alternative path towards collaboration, a ‘data federation’ opens the benefits to a new range of people, allowing smaller and less digitally mature organisations the chance to develop shared value from their digital assets, cultivate cooperative relationships, and build their capacity for strategic coordination.\n\nAbout the speaker\nRichard Woodall is a writer and researcher with an interest in the culture and political economy of digital technologies. For the past year his work at Etic Lab has focussed on the theory and practice of building Data Federations","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3259429,"full_duration":3259429,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":970678468,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2021-01-22T17:30:02Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-federations-collaborate-without-sharing","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-data-federations-collaborate-without-sharing","playback_count":340,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":970678468,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:970678468","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Data federations – collaborate without sharing","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/970678468","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:970678468","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/hIeaEJnPEFal_m.json","display_date":"2021-01-22T17:27:14Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:970678468/85b9e69d-8c8d-46e1-a98b-fafd6e1a1e16/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":3259429,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:970678468/85b9e69d-8c8d-46e1-a98b-fafd6e1a1e16/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":3259429,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:970678468/09142d22-2904-4be8-8253-5b8285617107/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3259395,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:970678468","station_permalink":"track-stations:970678468","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IjRkMDc5MjUzLTIyM2QtNDNhMS1iOTJiLWZjMTRkNDkwNTI1ZCIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.bdcFbVvg1EcwU38FjOit8GRN1rmviCGImQDTosMNjx4","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

This increases their trustworthiness within their network. We tend to trust people in white-collar professions because they are certified by a credible and highly respected third party. They have well established ethical codes of conduct, like the Hippocratic Oath for medical professionals.\n\nSuch a credibility stamp doesn’t exist in data. We have no way to tell if people in data have the same level of credibility. Not having data professionalised could be a threat to all of us, customers, clients, organisations and society as a whole. Low trust or a lack of it can compromise an organisation’s reputation and stifle innovation.\n\nData needs to be professionalised in order for Chief Data Officers, Chief Information Officers and Chief Technology Officers to demonstrate and build trust with their internal and external audiences. What businesses need to do with data must be codified – there is a lack of clarity around what people should be doing – around skills, ethics and infrastructure. That gap might be indicative of the low professionalisation of the field.\n\nIn this episode the panellists will explore whether a lack of formal AI and data literacy in the boardroom is a significant risk to an organisation’s reputation. \n\nThis podcast was recorded remotely over Cleanfeed.

The established approach to stats releases, of PDF commentary and accompanying spreadsheet tables is part of the picture, but not enough in this age of data, the web and automation. That means big changes to technology choices and more importantly to culture, data governance and mindset.\n\nAbout the speakers\nBill Roberts is CEO of Swirrl, a company specialising in software for government organisations to publish their data in standards-based machine-readable ways. As well as providing the software platform for statistics.gov.scot, Swirrl works with the Office for National Statistics, Defra, MHCLG, the Scottish Government and others on ensuring open government data can have the maximum positive impact. Swirrl is a member of the W3C.\n\nDarren Barnes has worked in ONS for nearly 30 years and much of this time has been spent in transformational roles.

Was it possible to find poetry within data?\nMy talk will cover how my brief interactions with Data as Culture at the ODI allowed me to combine it with my love of classic poetry and find my own unique interpretation of the world.

How it is collected, used and shared can have huge impacts – both direct and indirect – on people’s lives. Data and its (mis)use shape how companies profit, how we consume, even how governments see and serve their populations.\nBut while some organisations are speaking more about responsible data and ethics, many members of the public still aren’t engaged. They see it as boring, dry or too technical to understand – let alone something they can have any real agency over. This is not their fault, but is often because they have not had enough opportunities to meaningfully engage. This needs to change.\nIn this lecture, Anna Scott will talk through creative approaches to engaging people in data issues – from illustrated reports to artworks, games to shadow puppets. She’ll talk about the importance of embedding nuance and asking open-ended questions, inviting audiences to actively form their perspectives and seek more agency. Anna will also make recommendations for people looking to apply these approaches, from putting message before format to enabling good design.\nAbout the speaker\nAnna Scott is a content strategist, trainer and storyteller, specialising in data ethics and rights issues. She works with clients on finding creative, compelling ways to meaningfully engage people in data and tech, giving them more agency and choice for a better, fairer future. Anna used to be Head of Content at the Open Data Institute.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":2239582,"full_duration":2239582,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":760647862,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:52Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":1,"permalink":"odi-fridays-narratives-and-nuance-creative-ways-to-engage-the-people-in-data-issues","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-narratives-and-nuance-creative-ways-to-engage-the-people-in-data-issues","playback_count":264,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":760647862,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:760647862","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"ODI Fridays: Narratives and nuance – creative ways to engage ‘the people’ in data issues","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/760647862","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:760647862","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/GhsyUPMI4BTQ_m.json","display_date":"2020-02-14T16:42:50Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:760647862/5fd5b156-9039-4f8d-94dd-71ecb72a48f8/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":2239582,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:760647862/5fd5b156-9039-4f8d-94dd-71ecb72a48f8/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":2239582,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:760647862/ad7e6875-e7b9-4f4b-9473-dcf3e3e5298c/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":2239554,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:760647862","station_permalink":"track-stations:760647862","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

They’ve written their data strategy and they recognise that interoperability is key – now they want different teams to talk to each other easily to achieve new and innovative things. Most organisations first try to start their data architecture from the middle – but this comes with its own problems.\nSimon Worthington, Founder of Register Dynamics will explain in this talk how most organisation’s data architecture already exists. People and teams in their organisations already have data models and are interoperating with others as part of their usual business. But how do organisations transform from ad-hoc, local-only thinking to a broad data architecture that is interoperable?\nSimon will explain how to find the architecture, untangle it and make it useful for everyone – including why doing it saves you time and money and lets new innovation happen.

So how can we ensure data about us is used fairly, and that people have agency over how data about them is collected, used and shared? \n\nIn this podcast, two of the report authors, Renate Samson and Anna Scott reflect on the work, and look ahead to a discussion about some of the issues it covers in next week’s ODI Summit.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":1814962,"full_duration":1814962,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Technology","has_downloads_left":false,"id":709707376,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:52Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":2,"permalink":"about-data-about-us","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/about-data-about-us","playback_count":309,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":709707376,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:709707376","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"","title":"About data about us","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/709707376","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:709707376","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/vTnW3NVAqkr1_m.json","display_date":"2019-11-08T11:18:38Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:709707376/d677d86a-7dea-44cf-91e0-2d2d51a8b675/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1814962,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:709707376/d677d86a-7dea-44cf-91e0-2d2d51a8b675/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":1814962,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:709707376/57d5094b-55ed-4fb7-b3d1-74545e41cb89/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":1814924,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:709707376","station_permalink":"track-stations:709707376","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

The fix will be slow, complex, and among many other things, we will need to put technology to good use to make things better.\n\nIn this talk, ODI Head of Technology Olivier Thereaux will share highlights and learnings from recent projects on technology to support trust, including ARCHANGEL, a collaboration with the University of Surrey and The National Archives on guaranteeing integrity of digital records, as well as the ODI’s recent work on technology for data trusts.\nAbout the speaker\n\nAs Head of Technology, Olivier leads the ODI’s work researching emerging tech, prototyping tools and services, and exploring the interplay of technology and policy.

This talk explores if Safetytech could be the answer.\nData and digital technology are transforming the way whole industries operate. However, a huge challenge persists in transferring these revolutionary technologies to improve safety and reduce risks, particularly in the critical infrastructure industries which underpin our modern society like energy, food, shipping and transportation.\nThe Lloyd’s Register Safety Accelerator was set up to help to accelerate the adoption and deployment of digital technology in industry for safety and risk purposes. In this talk, Safety Accelerator Manager, Serena Connor, will share highlights and learnings from the programme’s funded pilot projects aimed at preventing critical operational failures, reducing human errors and saving lives across energy, transport and food industries.\nAbout the speaker\n\nAfter graduating from Stanford University, Serena worked for Washington, DC-based PR firm, Tigercomm, specialising in renewable energy, clean tech and environmental advocacy communications, before joining the Future Cities Catapult in London. Serena now works with innovation consultancy, Tenshi, where she helps corporate and public organisations collaborate to solve challenges.

Increasingly shifting to the preservation of easily manipulated digital records, sometimes kept in the dark for decades before release, their role is rapidly changing and their viability increasingly challenged.\n\nIn this talk, ODI Head of Technology Olivier Thereaux will share highlights and learnings from the ARCHANGEL project, a collaboration with the University of Surrey and The National Archives, and will show that, sometimes, “use some machine learning and put it on a blockchain” actually may be the right answer.\n\n(ARCHANGEL is funded by EPSRC Grant Ref EP/P03151X/1)\n\nAbout the speaker\nAs Head of Technology, Olivier leads the ODI’s work researching emerging tech, prototyping tools and services, and exploring the interplay of technology and policy.

It analyses and visualises numbers from and about government – on everything from staff numbers to public perceptions – to help politicians, civil servants, civil society and the public better understand what central government looks like in the UK. The Whitehall Monitor 2015 annual report looks at what happened under the coalition government from 2010 to 2015. Gavin Freeguard, one of the authors, talks us through some of the highlights.\n\nGavin Freeguard is a senior researcher at the Institute for Government.

Each lecture lasts for around 20 minutes, leaving time for questions afterwards. The lectures don’t require any specialist knowledge, but are focused around communicating the meaning and impact of open data in all areas of life.\n\nEach week the lectures are streamed live on YouTube and then uploaded to our YouTube and Vimeo channels.

The UK spends £250 billion every year on public spending contracts, including vital public services like the NHS and it’s important that this money is spent as efficiently as possible.\n\nAs part of an ASI fellowship, William Jones worked in collaboration with the UK Cabinet Office to increase the number of companies bidding on these contracts. He did this by automatically recommending them contracts which are available and relevant, using publicly accessible information from UK companies. The web application William built is called Contracts Recommender. His talk will explain the public sources of information he uses as well as how Contracts Recommender works.\n\nWilliam Jones was recently awarded the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the Cambridge Computer Laboratory with Distinction. During the ASI fellowship he first worked on a deep learning image classification project with Tractable.io, using the convolutional neural network framework Caffe.

He was previously political adviser on culture, media and sport to Harriet Harman MP and, before that, deputy director of the Orwell Prize and senior researcher at the Media Standards Trust.\n\nThe slides to this talk can be found here - https://www.scribd.com/doc/258880858/Friday-lunchtime-lecture-When-the-dust-settles-open-data-and-the-2015-general-election\n\nOur videos: bit.ly/odi_vimeo\nOur photos: bit.ly/odi_flickr\nOur audio: bit.ly/odi_soundcloud\nOur slides: bit.ly/odi_scribd\nOur tweets: bit.ly/ODIHQ_tweets\nOur website: theodi.org\nODI Summit videos: bit.ly/odisummit_video\nWhat is open data?: bit.ly/what-is-open-data","downloadable":true,"download_count":5,"duration":1700809,"full_duration":1700809,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"odifridays","has_downloads_left":true,"id":196116612,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:55Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":0,"permalink":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-data-and-the-2015-general-election-data","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/friday-lunchtime-lecture-open-data-and-the-2015-general-election-data","playback_count":566,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":null,"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"Open Data Institute\" ODI \"gavin freeguard\" 2015 \"general election\" Uk Politics \"open data a\" \"whitehall monitor\" \"institute for government\"","title":"Friday Lunchtime Lecture: Open Data And The 2015 General Election Data","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196116612","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:196116612","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/jFcTM7hiTcVY_m.json","display_date":"2015-03-16T10:25:09Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:196116612/d7eb7161-7b29-4577-a591-dde3122e0b30/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1700809,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:196116612/d7eb7161-7b29-4577-a591-dde3122e0b30/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1700809,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:196116612","station_permalink":"track-stations:196116612","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.

But it also points to areas where open data is having impact, and highlights factors that appear to contribute to greater political, economic and social outcomes from open data initiatives.\n\nListen to the track to hear about the Barometer findings, dig deeper into the methodology, hear about how you can re-mix the data (all the underlying data is open data of course), and discuss the future of open data metrics and measurement.\n\nSpeakers\n\nTim Davies is a PhD candidate at the University of Southampton Web Science Doctoral Training Centre, and Affiliate at the Harvard Berkman Centre for Internet and Society. He was previously open data research coordinator at the World Wide Web Foundation, leading the development of the Open Data in Developing Countries project, and working on the research and write-up of the Open Data Barometer. He tweets as @timdavies.\n\nDr Savita Bailur is open data research lead at the World Wide Web Foundation, working on the development of a new programme of open data action research in Africa and Asia, designed to discover context-appropriate ways of closing the data divide.

Film maker Manu Luksch did just that with her sci-fi fairy tale film ‘FACELESS.'\r\n\r\nOur lives are being captured in a multitude of ways: across social media, mobile and telephone communications, on the street. In the light what’s been reported this summer about the NSA, GCHQ and other governments, Manu’s film is particularly timely. \r\n\r\nUsing CCTV footage of herself requested via the Data Protection Act and blocking out the faces of anyone else captured on it, Manu's film imagines a faceless world - with herself as the only woman with a face. Manu will be discussing our surveilled society and what the future might hold for us.\r\n\r\nThe trailer referenced in this podcast can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLzJCeGYgbg","downloadable":true,"download_count":15,"duration":1399066,"full_duration":1399066,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Lecture","has_downloads_left":true,"id":112766764,"kind":"track","label_name":"","last_modified":"2020-07-28T13:25:57Z","license":"cc-by-sa","likes_count":0,"permalink":"odi-fridays-faceless-what-if","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/odi-fridays-faceless-what-if","playback_count":316,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":null,"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"open institute \"lunchtime lecture\" \"odi fridays\" film \"Manu Luksch\" Filmaker FACELESS Surveillance NSA CCTV GCHQ \"Data protection act\" ODI","title":"ODI Fridays: FACELESS - what if all our lives were recorded? with Manu Luksch","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/112766764","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:112766764","user_id":34504445,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/LBaKMR9Etns9_m.json","display_date":"2013-09-27T14:17:57Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:112766764/ad76ed24-286a-4cf4-8a8d-64114dc30cf9/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1399066,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-widget.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:112766764/ad76ed24-286a-4cf4-8a8d-64114dc30cf9/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":1399066,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:112766764","station_permalink":"track-stations:112766764","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJHQiIsInN1YiI6IiIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTg0NTcyM30.NPiyO-wZwLdj37MGAF-xjsMK3jeOalyamocmTCJi7Jo","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000657293990-cn4n5e-large.jpg","city":"London","comments_count":1,"country_code":"GB","created_at":"2013-01-30T18:01:29Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}},"description":"Listen to podcasts from the Open Data Institute – discussing the impacts of data across areas including health, cities, the built environment, government and finance.
